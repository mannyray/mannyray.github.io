Hello! My name is Stan Zonov. I am UWaterloo graduate in [BMath ~ Honours Computer Science, Joint Applied Mathematics]({{site.url}}/courses/) and graduate in [Masters of Mathematics at Uwaterloo](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/14740). This past summer I have biked across [Canada]({{ site.url }}/travel/2019/08/31/bike_trip/) and currently am looking for a job.


I have created this website to share stuff that I am currently working on and find interesting in order to keep my friends and acquantaines in the loop. When I have the time, I post the stuff here in hopes that it will inspire the reader to try something new.

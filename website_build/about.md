Hello! I am a University of Waterloo graduate of [Honours Computer Science, Joint Applied Mathematics]({{site.url}}/courses/) and [Masters of Mathematics](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/14740). After finishing my studies, I biked across [Canada](https://twotired.ca). Four years later, I am in [Winnipeg]({{ site.url }}/photos/winnipeg/) working as a software development engineer.

Life in Winnipeg is divided into two seasons: winter and summer. During the summer I enjoy long distance cycling and gardening while during the winter I enjoy skating and cross country skiing. Year round I enjoy working on various little programming projects which I share with you here on this website. I hope that my posts will inspire you to try something new.

Reach me at `hello at szonov dot com`.

Hello!

My name is Stan. I enjoy [cycling](https://twotired.ca/), [adventures]({{ site.url }}/programming/2024/05/11/what-is-leadership/), and [photography]({{ site.url }}/photos/)! I have a background in [software development](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanzonov/), [computer science]({{ site.url }}/courses/), and [applied mathematics](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/14740).

I have created this website to share stuff that I am working on and find interesting. I hope that my posts will inspire the readers to try something new.

 Reach out to `hello at szonov dot com` if you have interesting thoughts, or ideas!

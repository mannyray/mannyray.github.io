Hello! My name is Stan. I am a University of Waterloo graduate of [BMath ~ Honours Computer Science, Joint Applied Mathematics]({{site.url}}/courses/) and [Masters of Mathematics](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/14740). After finishing my studies, I biked across [Canada](https://twotired.ca). Two years later, I am in [Winnipeg]({{ site.url }}/photos/winnipeg/) working as a Software Development Engineer.


I have created this website to share stuff that I am working on and find interesting with my friends. I hope that my posts will inspire the readers to try something new. Please reach out to `hello at szonov dot com` if you have any questions.

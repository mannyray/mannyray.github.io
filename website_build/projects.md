Various projects I have completed listed in no particular order. Languages used include `C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `Matlab`, `Javascript`, `SQL` and `Scala`.

 - [Kalman filter](https://github.com/mannyray/KalmanFilter). Implementation of various Kalman filters in `C++` and `Matlab` including EKF, UKF, EnKF, cd-EKF and square root implementations. Code developed for use in graduate research. 
 
 - [Master's Thesis](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/14740). Kalman Filter Based Sensor Placement For Burgers Equation.
 
 - [Modelling and Parameter Estimation]({{ site.url }}/programming/2019/06/19/stan-working-with-stans/). Using `Stan`, `R` and `Matlab` estimating unknown parameter values from a pendulum system based on the measurements. A pendulum `Javascript` app showing the differences between various numerical approximation is [here]({{ site.url }}/pendulum/simple_pendulum/index.html) with a write up [here]({{ site.url }}/programming/2016/12/20/pendulum/).
 
 - [Web scraper](https://github.com/mannyray/automaticWebScraper). Code for setting up and running a webscraper on `AWS` that scrapes data on an hourly basis and stores it. The scraper is run using `Python` and `Bash` with `SQL` to later then parse the results. More write up [here]({{ site.url }}/programming/2018/12/06/simple-scraper/).
 
 - [Google App Script emailer]({{ site.url }}/programming/2017/07/16/Creating-a-notification/). Code to create a Google Script (`Javascript` like) based app that can email based on curl command - a hacky notification system. Another script at the bottom of [here]({{ site.url }}/programming/2016/12/20/pendulum/) recreates the automatic 'Happy Birthday From Your Dentist' but now you're the dentist and the patients are your friends all using Google App scripts. 
 
 - [Machine learning](https://lintool.github.io/bigdata-2017w/assignment6.html). A spam classifier built and trained using `MapReduce` and `Spark` as part of class work. `Scala` and `Hadoop` were also utilized in the course to work on Big Data concepts using large cluster set ups.
 
 - [Police traffic stops]({{ site.url }}/programming/2017/03/14/Some-graphs/). Using publicly available traffic stop data from Waterloo Regional police I plotted the data in various plots to get a better idea about traffic stops - from the most dangerous intersections(Kind and University) to when you're least likely to get stopped (6 am or Christmas time).
 
  - [Fractal image compression](https://github.com/mannyray/fractalMapping). Image compression library in `C++` that uses fractal concepts to compress images. The linked repository explains the concept and math behind the code really well.
 
 - [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/mannyray). Love to solve coding challenges not just for interviews but for the fun of solving hard problems. Currently solved  `109/563` various problems in `C++`. For some of the exceptionally challenging problems I have created posts discussing my solutions in detail - [Beautiful-3-set]({{ site.url }}/programming/2017/07/14/Beautiful-3-set/) or [Triplets]({{ site.url }}/programming/2016/08/29/triplets/).

- [Space Shooter](https://github.com/fvranes/Space_Adventure). The project was completed for a highschool computer science class final summative with my buddy Filip Vranes. Elements of `JavaScript`, `HTML` and `CSS` were all used in order to achieve the end product. The first link is to the repo and the actual game can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/Space_Adventure).

 - [OS161 Operating system]({{ site.baseurl }}/courses/cs350) with more info [here](http://os161.eecs.harvard.edu/). Upgraded and built on a basic operating system using `C` over the course of a semester in CS 350. Implemented locks, memory management and system calls and other low level stuff. Code in private repository as it was written as part of a course project.

- [BB7K ~ Text based monopoly]({{ site.baseurl }}/courses/cs246). The following project was the final summative of Object Oriented Software Development course. I worked on this project with John Rizkalla over two weeks using `C++` and employing many Object Oriented Programming concepts. Code in private repository as it was written as part of a course project.

- [Vending Machine Craze]({{ site.baseurl }}/courses/cs343). I named this originally nameless project based on the problem details. This project was a masterpiece of my concurrency course CS 343 developed with Wesley Chalmers. Language used was a `C++` derivative language [Î¼C++](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs343/codeExamples.shtml#ucpp).  Code in private repository as it was written as part of a course project.

 - [Infinite Fun](https://github.com/mannyray/InfiniteFun): A `Java` Object Oriented Programming based game that I worked on with as part of group project in highschool(Dan Wei and Braden Cok). Here is a [screen cap]({{ site.url }}/assets/platform.png). We called it Infinite Fun because there was no way of beating the game... it just kept going (just like Space Shooter).

Hey everyone! I have recently completed a bike trip across Canada - from Vancouver to St John's. The trip took two months - from June 23rd to August 23rd. I completed my thesis for my masters in late spring and thus had the time for such a journey. There were many reasons for the trip, some of which I haven't fully formulated myself. The main reason was a desire for adventure and to challenge myself to something big. I will be eventually posting a more detailed and organized day to day account with pictures, videos and text. This will be in order to help remember things for myself in the future as well create an information source for those that are curious or are considering bike trips themselves.

Hello dear reader!

I have created a video of a project I have been working on for a while. In addition to being a dear reader you can now be a dear viewer too! I am very excited to share this with you.

The video is about an automatic mechanism I created for capturing pictures of trains that go across a bridge in view of my apartment.

Please go [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVF_0MooQE) to see the video!

In the video I reference code that I have written as part of the project. The code is all discussed in my previous few blog posts:

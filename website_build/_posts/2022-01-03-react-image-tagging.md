Hello dear reader!

I created an in-browser image tagging tool using React and Python/Flask for the backend. The code is [here](https://github.com/mannyray/ImageTagger) along with a very detailed explanation in the README.md.

The tool can be used for tagging many pictures with ease and then later for searching for the images via tags. Here are some sample screenshots:

It was great to learn React. It was unsual and the `setState` command at times seemed like the `goto` command that I always thought was improper to use. It took some time to adjust. I am grateful for the learning experience.

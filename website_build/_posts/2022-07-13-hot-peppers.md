I have created another video. Please go [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atcKhoJ6vCc) to see the video! This time it is about my experimentation with growing hot pepper plants indoors during the winter. These plants provided me with inspiration, joy and a taste of spring. I am very grateful for the experience and look forward to growing more stuff this upcoming winter. Summer is so short here that I am already preparing.

I am starting to get the hang of making videos and will likely make more. I like the creativity involved and the opportunity to film non programming/technical stuff. Maybe next time I will make a video of me playing something on the piano. Stay tuned!

I"h<p>There is a lot of easily accessible data online waiting to be explored and analyzed. Recently, I came across a <a href="https://ioos.noaa.gov/news/the-first-u-s-ioos-biological-data-training-workshop/">work shop</a> for a U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) Biological Data Training Workshop. Workshops are great as they usually post their code and slide shows for everyone to see and explore. One of the code examples on the posted <a href="https://github.com/ioos/BioData-Training-Workshop">github</a> dealt with animal telemetry data - letâ€™s explore the data together. First load the libraries</p>

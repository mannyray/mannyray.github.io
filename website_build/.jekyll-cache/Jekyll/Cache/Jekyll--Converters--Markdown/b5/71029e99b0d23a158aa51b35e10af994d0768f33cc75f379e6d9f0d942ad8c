I"“<p>Hello! My name is Stan. I am a University of Waterloo graduate of <a href="https://szonov.com/courses/">BMath ~ Honours Computer Science, Joint Applied Mathematics</a> and <a href="https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/14740">Masters of Mathematics</a>. After finishing my studies, I biked across <a href="https://twotired.ca">Canada</a>. A year later, I am in <a href="https://szonov.com/photos/winnipeg/">Winnipeg</a> working as a Software Development Engineer.</p>

<p>I have created this website to share stuff that I am working on and find interesting with my friends. I hope that my posts will inspire the readers to try something new.</p>

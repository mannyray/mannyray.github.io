I"`<p>Apologies - I have not posted for over a year. During this time, I have been busy working on a couple of projects that are not yet ready to share.</p>

<p>Last summer, I wrote a guide on how to setup a <a href="https://github.com/mannyray/AWScommentSection">comment section</a> hosted on AWS as part of learning more about AWSâ€™ DynamoDB and Lambda. I enjoyed creating the comment section. I decided against adding it to this site since I do not get much traffic here.</p>

<p>Found the output of my final project for my grade 10 computer science course (eleven years ago I think). The animation is supposed to be a Star Wars like scene. I remember being especially proud of the space battle between the two groups of ships as it looked suprisingly good. What was your first project?</p>

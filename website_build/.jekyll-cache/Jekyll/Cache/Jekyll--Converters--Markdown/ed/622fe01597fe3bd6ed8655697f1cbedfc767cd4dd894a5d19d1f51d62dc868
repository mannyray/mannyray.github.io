I"<p>A lot of data nowadays is stored online or in the ‘cloud’, separating clients and servers by kilometres upon kilometres of distance. The client moves their data to a server with more memory and speed to be able to compute things in the cloud at rates faster than they could ever do so by themselves. The client storing the data on the server has to be able to trust the server and that the server is uncompromised in order to keep their information secure. Ways in which this can be done will be discussed in this post.</p>

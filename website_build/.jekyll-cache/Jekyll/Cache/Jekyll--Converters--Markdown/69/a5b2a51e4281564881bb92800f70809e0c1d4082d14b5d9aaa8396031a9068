I"ÿ<p>Computer Security and Privacy</p>

<p>Computer Security and Privacy opened my eyes to many of the weaknesses of computer systems. The course also gave the opportunity to interact with these concepts through assignments.</p>

<p>For one of the assignments the student was required to hack into a system using different approaches including buffer overflow and string format. I understood the basic concept of these approaches, but when implementing them I did not â€˜calculateâ€™ my solution effectively. This resulted in a lot of wasted time through blindly brute forcing my solution. I learned a good lesson that sometimes it is best to do extensive planning compared to minimal. This sounds like a very basic lesson, but in the context of CS school assignments this was rarely necessary as they were often very straightforward (Excuses, excuses, excusesâ€¦.I know).</p>

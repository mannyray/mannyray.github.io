I"Ú<p>Statistics</p>

<p>The final required stat course for my program. (Yay, I filled a course requirement category) Now, donâ€™t get me wrong, I loved the stat courses. I will even see if I can squeeze one more as an elective later.</p>

<p>The course revolved heavily around maximum likelihood functions, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.</p>

<p>The examples in class werenâ€™t always captivating but it was very clear to see how the class concepts relate to every day life.</p>

<p>I look forward to applying these concepts learned in this course in the future.</p>

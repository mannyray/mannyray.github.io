I"<p>Linear Algebra 2</p>

<p>The course is very pattern based. A lot of theorems and ideas are repeated but in different words, settings and applications. However, do not let the repetition fool you. The sheer volume of theorems is overwhelming and it is important to know how to use them.</p>

<p>I love and respect eigenvalues, but they give me nightmares from time to time.</p>

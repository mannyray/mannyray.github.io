I"Õ<p>I was looking for sets of data to play around with and I came across the <a href="http://www.wrps.on.ca/inside-wrps/corporate-planning-systems">Waterloo Regional Police Service</a> data that is available to the public. I created some graphs of the data for the reader to check out. The data was filtered for vehicle stops for the year 2015. Time and location data was plotted. If you are interested in the scripts used in generating the plots, then let me know.</p>

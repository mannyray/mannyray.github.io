I"o<p>This is something that I did a while ago but kept forgetting to post. I needed to build a web scaper of sorts that would save online data at certains times of the day. Since I did not have a desktop or my own server I needed to find a location for my scripts to run on their own. For this purpose I chose Amazon Web Service (AWS). At the time AWS provided a basic free EC2 instance (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud). In Amazon’s owns words EC2 can be used ‘to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage’. Essentially it is a computer that runs nonstop and you connect to set and specify tasks for it to work on. For the example in this post I scraped the <a href="https://github.com/uWaterloo/api-documentation/blob/master/v2/weather/current.md">weather</a> in Waterloo (I scrapped other stuff as well).</p>

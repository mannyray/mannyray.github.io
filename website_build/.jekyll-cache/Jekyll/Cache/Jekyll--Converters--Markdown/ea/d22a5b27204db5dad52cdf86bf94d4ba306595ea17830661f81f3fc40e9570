    <p><a href="/courses/cs350">OS161 Operating system</a> with more info <a href="http://os161.eecs.harvard.edu/">here</a>. Upgraded and built on a basic operating system using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code> over the course of a semester in CS 350. Implemented locks, memory management and system calls and other low level stuff. Code in private repository as it was written as part of a course project.</p>

  <li>
    <p><a href="/courses/cs246">BB7K ~ Text based monopoly</a>. The following project was the final summative of Object Oriented Software Development course. I worked on this project with John Rizkalla over two weeks using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C++</code> and employing many Object Oriented Programming concepts. Code in private repository as it was written as part of a course project.</p>

  <li>
    <p><a href="/courses/cs343">Vending Machine Craze</a>. I named this originally nameless project based on the problem details. This project was a masterpiece of my concurrency course CS 343 developed with Wesley Chalmers. Language used was a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C++</code> derivative language <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs343/codeExamples.shtml#ucpp">Î¼C++</a>.  Code in private repository as it was written as part of a course project.</p>

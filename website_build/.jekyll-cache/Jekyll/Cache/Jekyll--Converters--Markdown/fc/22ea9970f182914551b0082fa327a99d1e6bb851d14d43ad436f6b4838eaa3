I"È<p>Mechanics</p>

<p>Mechanics was a very enjoyable course. The course turned out to be very straightforward and intuitive. The physics taken back in highschool three years ago and calculus made this one of my favourite and easiest courses of my 3B semester. The course still introduced enough new content to keep it interesting. Definitely worth taking.</p>

I"	<p>Back in September, I had the wonderful opportunity to participate in my first hackathon at Hack the North. It was nice to see so many enthusiastic people filled with ideas and talent all concentrated in one area. The keynote speaker: Vinod Khosla, presented his opinions and experiences that were inspiring to see. I especially enjoyed his views on focus and motivation from his life with which he achieved great success. A video of the interview is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNsFPjdm5U">here</a>.</p>

I"z<p>Just finished another term at University of Waterloo. This term was very interesting and at the same time tough. I took PHYS122, AMATH353, CS371 and CS343. In addition, I started working on a University Research Assistant (URA) project which I will post more details later on. Currently doing a work term and enjoying the beautiful summer term and increase in free time.</p>

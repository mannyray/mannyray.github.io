Hey! This page is going to house some of the programming related projects that I have worked on. A bit about what I am studying:



[Courses At University of Waterloo]({{ site.baseurl }}/courses)



**Projects:**


 - _OS161 Operating system:_ Upgraded and built on an basic operating system using C over the course of a semester. More details about the course here: [OS161]({{ site.baseurl }}/courses/cs350).



 - _Text based monopoly (bb7k):_ The following project was the final summative of [CS 246 - Object-Oriented Software Development]({{ site.baseurl }}/courses/cs246). I worked on this project with John Rizkalla using C++ and many Object Oriented Programming concepts. You can read more on this on the cs 246 link.



 - _Space Shooter:_ The following project is a basic space shooter game. The game was completed for a highschool computer science class final summative with my buddy Filip Vranes. Elements of Javascript, HTML5 and CSS were all used in order to achieve the end product. The language and elements required for the game were all learned during a tight time frame given for the summative, making the memories of the project even brighter. Here is [the code](https://github.com/fvranes/Space_Adventure) and here is [the game]({{ site.baseurl }}/Space_Adventure).



 - _Platform falling game:_ A Java Object Oriented Programming based game that I worked on with as part of group project in highschool. Here is a [screen cap]({{ site.url }}/assets/platform.png). If you are interested in the creation of this or any of the other projects, then just shoot me a message!

Hello! My name is Stan Zonov. I am a recent UWaterloo graduate in [BMath ~ Honours Computer Science, Joint Applied Mathematics]({{site.url}}/courses/). Currently back in Waterloo furthering my studies.



I have created this website to share stuff that I am currently working on and find interesting. When I have the time, I post the stuff here in hopes that it will inspire the reader to try something new.

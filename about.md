Hello! My name is Stan Zonov. I am a student enrolled in Computer Science Honours Joint Applied Mathematics program at the University of Waterloo. I have created this website to share stuff that I am currently working on or find interesting. When I have the time, I post the stuff here in hopes that it will inspire the reader to try something new. Enjoy!

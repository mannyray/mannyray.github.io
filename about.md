Hello! My name is Stanislav Zonov, or simply Stan. I am a fourth year student enrolled in Computer Science Honours Joint Applied Mathematics program at the University of Waterloo. I used to think that the two areas are separate, but as I continue my studies I increasingly observe how closely they are interconnected. This realization fuels my passions and my love to apply the knowledge and skills learned in both of these areas to solve all kinds of problems and challenges.

Past experience with personal programming projects and my university courses have led me to become proficient in multiple languages, programming paradigms and concepts. From multiple successful programming projects and assignments I have evolved to become extremely adaptable to new environments and tight deadlines. In addition, my leadership background from working as a lifeguard/swimming instructor to volunteering as a counsellor at a camp make me a motivated and independent individual. Pairing my knowledge with my background, make me a problem crushing machine, which you will observe yourself the next time you see me.

Other than studying and studying and studying and studying... (the best part of being a student at UW), I also really enjoy staying fit by running to school and going to the gym daily. The activities help me stay organized, hyper-motivated and able to achieve any goal I set! I highly recommend trying it!

  <article class="post-content">
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Hello dear reader! In this post I will be discussing how to control a DSLR camera using an Android app, Raspberry Pi, gphoto2 and some <a href="https://github.com/mannyray/bluetoothPhoto">code</a>. I found this capability very useful for my endeavours and hope that you may as well for yours. I will go over motivations, how to setup, linked code and an example use case. If you are restless, at the end I have a gif of a time-lapse I was able to create with the help of this app.</p>

<p>Here is a view of the deployed system:</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/schema.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>gphoto2 is a free application that can be used to control a variety of <a href="http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php">different cameras</a> via commandline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Raspberry Pi can be replaced with another computer. Raspberry Pi is chosen as it is leightweight and cheap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Android app is useful because it allows for wireless, remote control and a nice user interface.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="here-are-reasons-why-you-may-find-the-setup-useful">Here are reasons why you may find the setup useful:</h2>

<h3 id="cameras-come-with-limitations">Cameras come with limitations</h3>

<p>In this blog I will be using the Canon M100.</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/m100.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the case of the M100, the camera has a limitation on how long you can take time-lapse photos for. In the image below, three screenshots from the M100 configuration screen show that you can set to take photos every 2 to 4 seconds and up to 900 shots. Combining the two upper limits you can only takes a time-lapse spanning an hour in time.</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/camera_settings.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>What if you want to take a time-lapse of a full day? With the use of a battery cable and this setup you can overcome such limitations. The Android acts as user interface enhancement instead of using gphoto2 commandline directly on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>M100 battery cable:</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/wired_battery.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="the-camera-manufacturer-provided-android-app-is-not-sufficient">The camera manufacturer provided Android app is not sufficient</h3>

<p>The Android app provided here can be modified to monitor for events for which regular manufacture provided Android apps for your camera will not have. Want to take picture at a specific time? Take a picture only when you detect something in the field of focus of cell phone camera? Take a picture when you say “action”? You will have to code this yourself for which the Android app introduced in this post provides a great starting point.</p>

<p>The programmatic freedom allows one to integrate your camera into a variety of applications.</p>

<h3 id="broken-camera-screen">Broken camera screen</h3>

<p>May sound like a stretch but I had this happen. Camera menu screen was busted. The app can be useful here for providing a basic screen interface.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-setup">How to Setup</h2>

<h3 id="install-gphoto2-on-raspberry-pi">Install gphoto2 on Raspberry Pi</h3>

<p>You will have to install gphoto2 software. <a href="https://github.com/gonzalo/gphoto2-updater">This</a> is a good repository on how to do this.</p>

<h3 id="connect-the-camera-to-the-raspberry-pi">Connect the Camera to the Raspberry Pi</h3>

<p>Connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi. In the case of the M100, I use the USB to mini USB B. Cable below:</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/wire.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The mini USB B port on the M100 is pictured below.</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/port.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The result will look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/connection.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Turn your camera on and see if your camera has a setting to stay on without sleeping. On the M100 the setting looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/never_off.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the Raspberry Pi terminal run</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ps aux | grep gphoto
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kill</code> on the non <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> results. Next run</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gphoto2 --shell
&gt;trigger-capture
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/initial_connection.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sometimes taking pictures will fail. In the image above, the failure was due to camera not focusing while in auto focus mode. For the second picture, I had to make sure I had better lighting.</p>

<p>gphoto2 supports many <a href="http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php">cameras</a> to varying degrees. Your debug process and figuring out how to run your camera will thus vary. Be patient. By searching your error on a search engine you can usually find a thread on gphoto2’s repository or some stackoverflow post discussing a potential workaround. Here are some links that I found useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2/issues/521">maybe you are using an older version of gphoto2</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2/issues/30">use debug mode</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2/issues/197">saving to sd card</a></li>
</ul>

<p>…happy debugging!</p>

<h3 id="connecting-raspberry-pi-to-android-phone">Connecting Raspberry Pi to Android Phone</h3>

<p>Connect your phone and Raspberry Pi together. There are many instructions online on how to do this like <a href="https://bluedot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pairpiandroid.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-bluetooth-server-on-raspberry-pi">Setting up the Bluetooth server on Raspberry Pi</h3>

<p>On the Raspberry Pi you will have to run</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo python server.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The python script can be found <a href="https://github.com/mannyray/bluetoothPhoto/tree/master/bluetooth_server">here</a>.</p>

<p>Apply a setting to your Raspberry Pi so it does not fall asleep and stays on.</p>

<p>If you experience errors: make sure to install the required packages. For potential debugging when failing to advertise I found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37913796/bluetooth-error-no-advertisable-device">this</a> to be helpful.</p>

<h3 id="build-the-android-app">Build the Android app</h3>

<p>You must be able to build the Android app using Android Studio. This can get a bit involved for a first time builder. I recommend starting <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp">here</a> to get introduced to the basics.</p>

<p>The location of the app code is <a href="https://github.com/mannyray/bluetoothPhoto/tree/master/bluetooth_android_app/Bluetooth">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="intermission">Intermission</h3>

<p>If you followed instructions above you now have</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bluetooth-paired the Android phone and Raspberry Pi</li>
  <li>Launched the Bluetooth server on the Raspberry Pi</li>
  <li>Connected your camera to the Raspberry Pi</li>
  <li>Built and installed the application on your Android.</li>
</ul>

<p>For illustration purposes I have setup the Raspberry Pi and camera.</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/test_setup.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The camera is connected to the Raspberry Pi and the battery is cable powered.</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/camera_test_setup.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The test subject image here is a map of Winnipeg:</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/camera_test_subject.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Bluetooth server on the Raspberry Pi is running and waiting for a connection.</p>

<h3 id="running-the-android-phone-app">Running the Android Phone App</h3>

<p>Now let us launch the Android application which is called “Bluetooth”. The landing page will look like</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/landing_page.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here is me holding the phone:</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/view_of_phone.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After pressing connect you will be redicted to</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/choose_page.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And the Raspberry Pi will accept the connection:</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/bluetooth_server_waiting.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When selecting “Single picture” and pressing the camera button you will see:</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/picture_taken.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Bluetooth server will reflect these pictures taken:</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/bluetooth_server_picture_taken.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The picture is also saved to the SD card of the camera.</p>

<p>The other option here is to take a time-lapse:</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/time_lapse.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The “Shutdown Signal” is for when you want to disconnect and quit the Bluetooth server. The app will then redict you back to the landing page.</p>

<h2 id="time-lapse-example">Time-lapse example</h2>

<p>Here is an example of the time-lapse feature. After the pictures were taken I combined them to form a gif. Earlier, I suggested that the M100’s time-lapse feature could be extended for a whole day. I was a bit lazy to do that for this post and did something that is quicker and would take up less memory:</p>

<p><img src="https://szonov.com/assets/dlsr_control/sand.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now the skeptical reader might ask: “Why do you need an Android app to send a single command to start executing a time-lapse or even a single photograph? Why not modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server.py</code> and run the code straight on the Raspberry Pi?”</p>

<p>It is true. In such cases the phone is unnecessary. I could just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gphoto2 --shell</code> in the terminal. However, for applications where you need more advance features, the Android phone is very versatile. In this <a href="https://szonov.com/programming/2021/03/28/prototype/">post</a> I describe such an advanced application that builds on top of the logic introduced here by using the phone’s camera and a Tensorflow model. This post is supposed to provide starting code and general introduction to combining the phone, camera and Raspberry Pi together. Happy hacking!</p>

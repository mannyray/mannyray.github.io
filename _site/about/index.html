  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Hello! My name is Stanislav Zonov, or simply Stan. I am a third year student enrolled in Computer Science Honours Joint Applied Mathematics program at the University of Waterloo. I have a strong passion for computer science and an equally strong passion for mathematics, somewhat of a taboo amongst the majority of my computer science peers.</p>

<p>I used to think that the two areas are separate, but as I continue my studies I increasingly observe how closely they are interconnected. This realization fuels my passions and my love to apply the knowledge and skills learned in both of these areas to solve all kinds of problems and challenges.</p>

<p>Past experience with personal programming projects and my university courses have led me to become profficient in multiple languages (C++, C, Racket, Javascript, Java), programming paradigms and concepts. From multiple succesful programming projects and assignments I have evolved to become extremely adaptable to new environments and tight deadlines. In addition, my leadership background from working as a lifeguard/swimming instructor to volunteering as a counsellor at a camp make me a motivated and independent individual. Pairing my knowledge with my background, make me a problem crushing machine, which you will observe yourself the next time you see me.</p>

<p>Other than studying and studying and studying and studying... (the best part of being a student at UW), I also really enjoy staying fit. Every morning I run 7km (unless the temperature is below -30 celcius... how soft of me!) and work out at the gym in the evening. The activities help me stay organized, hyper-motivated and able to acheive any goal I set! I highly recommend trying it!</p>

		<p>Space Shooter</p>
		<p>The following project is a basic space shooter game. The game was completed for a highschool computer science class final summative with my buddy Filip Vranes.
		Elements of Javascript, HTML5 and CSS were all used in order to acheive the end product.
		The language and elements required for the game were all learned during a tight time frame given for the summative, making the memories of the project even brighter.

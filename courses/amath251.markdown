Introduction to Differential Equations

I loved the material presented in this class especially when it related to modelling real life scenarios such as population dynamics or oscillations. A large portion of the math courses taken up to now has been very theoretical. In this class it was the opposite which at times was challenging but interesting nonetheless.
Differential equation introduction in first year calculus was brief and left an aura of mystery. This course cleared this by presenting techniques and methods for solving differential equations and applying them to solve word problems.
I also had the opportunity to use Maple as part of the coursework. Maple was fun to use as it saved time from doing integration by hand. However, the language syntax was hard to pick up at first as specific mistakes were not clear when made and debugging took a while because of a small online Maple community.

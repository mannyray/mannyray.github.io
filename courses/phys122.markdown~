Waves, Electricity and Magnetism

The material presented in this course was more interesting and challenging than the material presented in PHYS 121. The assignments this round did not involve an online submission system which got rid of the crazy bonus marks that were possible in PHYS 121. 


I wish I had taken this course earlier because it would have helped in AMATH 231 and other AMATH courses in terms of understanding the background material. This course did align with AMATH 353 by helping understand the derivation of the wave PDE.


Some sample class material:

Probability


In STAT 230 I got introduced to basic counting techniques. At the time the introduction of combinations and permutations was absolutely mind blowing. Being able to quantify different complex probabilities with the use of these techniques gave me new skills to add to my 'mathematical arsenal' and approaches to solving different problems.

Distributions like the poisson, normal, binomial helped me understand how many day-to-day events can be modelled, studied and interpreted.

In addition to learning how to count the ways I could do a specific task or arrange a set of elements (which became very applicable in many settings later on) I also learned the central limit theorem.

Even though the time spent exploring the implications of the theorem weren't long, it still was a great introduction to the types of concepts that would be learned in the upcoming STAT 231 (Statistics).

Public Speaking


Nice contrast to all the math and computer science courses. The assignments involved planning and presenting a speech to fellow classmates and answering their questions. The class helped me understand my weaknesses in my public speaking.

One of my speeches was a persuasive one about how students need to learn basic programming. Sadly, a lot of people did not agree. Oh well. I will just learn it by myself.

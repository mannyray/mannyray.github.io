title:  "STAT 231"
---

The final required stat course for my program. (Yay, I filled a course requirement category) Now, don't get me wrong, I loved the stat courses. I will even see if I can squeeze one more as an elective later.

The course revolved heavily around maximum likelihood functions, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. 

The examples in class weren't always captivating but it was very clear to see how the class concepts relate to every day life. 

I look forward to applying these concepts learned in this course in the future.

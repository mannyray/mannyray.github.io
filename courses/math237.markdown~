Calculus 3 for Honours Mathematics


This course introduced multivariable calculus. The material had a similar vibe to Calculus 1 except now there were more variables to deal with.

First year math was tough. After first year, I thought I was really bad at math. My marks were low and I felt like I wasn't absorbing the material as I should have been. Something about looking at math questions on an exam and having no idea what is going on was a little discouraging. Second year, I decided to get my fecal matter together and change things. As a result, this course became a personal success story. Good times.

Usually studying during the winter semester is difficult. The reason for that is that the cold weather chills regular tasks to a slower pace. When you think about it, it seems that the only disadvantage of the winter season is that you have to spend more time putting on clothes. However, I believe that this very task makes everyone less reluctant to do stuff as we all have a lazy side to ourselves. 

I initially experienced this slow down myself this semester as I found it more difficult to push myself to wake up for runs or go to the gym.

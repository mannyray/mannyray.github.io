There will be two topics to this post. The first one will be about pendulums and the second one will be about automation. The topics aren't related, but I put them together anyways. I hope you enjoy reading about them!


## Pendulums

Up to this current point, I have taken a few courses that deal with simple harmonic motion. PHYS 121, PHYS 122, AMATH 251, AMATH 351 are only some of the courses that have covered this topic. It occurs so frequently in my AMATH courses that I thought it would very selfish of me to hord all the knowledge to myself.


Simple harmonic motion is used to model periodic motion, motion that repeats itself after a set period of time. Some examples would be a spring or a pendulum. In applied mathematics there is an attraction to this subject as simple harmonic motion occurs all over the place. Starting off and understanding something simple as the pendulum, we can work on tackling more complicated problems.



When we think about a simple pendulum, we think of a string attached to a pivot on one end and a heavy mass attached on the other $($assuming string is massless$)$. Something like this:

Since we are talking about applied mathematics here, then we need some sort of equation to work with. So how does one turn the pendulum motion into an equation?


One thing we can start off with is the $F = ma$ equation (Newton's third law). The $F$ is the net force and in our case will be the force acting on the mass hanging on to the string, $m$ the mass and $a$ the acceleration of the mass. Since we are dealing with the pendulum then what we will be using to keep track of position will be the angle ($\theta$) of the string from the pendulum's equilibrium position. We now upgrade our image to the following:

To understand the net force on the mass, we need to consider all the forces acting on the mass. These forces will be gravity and tension of the string. By understanding the forces acting upon the mass we can then understand the motion induced by the forces:

The black force is caused by tension of the string and the blue force is caused by gravity. The gravity force can be broken down to the two red forces with the help of geometry. Since the mass on the string is not flying off the string then it must be the case that $F_g cos(\theta) = F_T$ and they cancel each other out. Therefore, the net force is $F = - mg sin(\theta)$. 




For the angle, $\theta$ is the angle, then velocity is $\theta'$ and acceleration is $\theta''$. If we want to consider the amount of distance the mass on the pendulum covered with a change of $\theta$ in the angle, then the distance must be the arc length covered by the motion - which would be $\theta l$ where $l$ is the length of the string ( if the pendulum was to do a full rotation, then that would be the circumference of a circle of radius - $l$, $2 \pi l$ ). Therefore the acceleration with respect to position (not angle) must be $l \theta''$. Using all this information we can derive the following:


$F = ma$


$- m g sin(\theta) = m l \theta''$


$ - g sin(\theta) = l \theta''$


$ \theta'' + \frac{g}{l}sin(\theta) = 0$



What we have derived is a differential equation for the motion of the pendulum. There is some sort of function $\theta$ that describes the angle of the pendulum from equilibrium as a function of $t$, time. Now whatever that function may be, it must satisfy out derived differential equation. We will now work on solving this equation.
